Java 1.5 support
================

soft-pkcs11 is now tested with the Java 1.5 pkcs11 module. To use a
pkcs11 module as a keystore you have to write a configuration file. A
sample one for soft-pkcs11 is includede in this directory.

To use it, update the configuration file where the PKCS11 module is
installed and run the command below in this directory (or use absolute
path to the configuration file).

keytool \
        -keystore NONE \
        -storetype PKCS11 \
        -providerClass sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 \
        -providerArg pkcs11.cfg \
        -list

If you get a "load failed" IOException, your configuration file might
be wrong. To get a known good configuration file, run make check in
the object tree and and the sample program will create a sample file
called test-rc-file.rc that points out sample certificates that are
included in with the distribution. You can use it with this command.

Example output:

	$ env SOFTPKCS11RC=../test-rc-file.rc keytool -keystore NONE -storetype PKCS11 -providerClass sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 -providerArg pkcs11.cfg -list
	Enter keystore password:  
	
	Keystore type: PKCS11
	Keystore provider: SunPKCS11-SoftToken
	
	Your keystore contains 2 entries
	
	User certificate, keyEntry,
	Certificate fingerprint (MD5): 34:54:37:E1:EF:03:6F:61:32:79:83:47:8C:ED:9A:55
	CA certificate, trustedCertEntry,
	Certificate fingerprint (MD5): E1:34:AF:32:19:47:A3:F4:37:F0:03:C1:3E:23:16:E7
