soft-pkcs11 is a software only pkcs11 implementation

It is built to handle mozilla and the pkinit extension to heimdal, if
you you think its lacking in functionality you expect to be there,
just send me a mail about it.

It only handles RSA, again, this is because I don't need more.

soft-pkcs11 currently uses OpenSSL for crypto and PEM operations.

Its not a full pkcs11 module, you need to add a configuration file in
your home directory ($HOME/.soft-token.rc) to specify what certifictes
you want to appear in the PKCS11 module. See the sample configuration
file in the distribution for help how to configure it. Your smart card
PIN will be treated as the passphrase for your private key file (if
you have one). Its not possible to import certificates and key into
the module, just to use configured certificates.

To make it work with Java 1.5 which includes a pkcs11 keystore. See
the sample program and configuration file java/ directory in the
distribution.
